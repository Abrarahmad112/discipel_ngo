                    <p style="font-family: Phenomena-Regular; font-size: 20px;">Bihar is one of the most flood prone states of India. According to the report of the National Commission on floods, 16.5% of the total flood affected area of the country is located in Bihar, while 22.1% of the affected population in
                        India lives in the alluvial plains of this state. This suggests a heavy concentration of flood-affected people over a smaller area. According to recent estimates 56.5% of the flood affected people in the country belong to Bihar
                        and of this 76% population belong to north Bihar.</p>
                </div>
                <p id="para-margin" style="margin-top:30px;font-family: Phenomena-Regular; font-size: 20px;">Discipleship Centre responded almost immediately to the Bihar floods that occurred in 2008 as the result of a breach in the river Kosi embankment. Our efforts were initially focused on the people living in four relief camps comprising
                    of 1450 displaced families from Saharsa District. DC started a child care centre adjacent to each camp and more than 500 children attended these centers. Two meals were provide to those residing in the camps.</p>
                <p id="para-margin" style="font-family: Phenomena-Regular; font-size: 20px;">CASE STUDY ON SANITATION: Govt. middle school situated in Ukhra village of Darbhanga district was started in 1958 with two rooms. Earlier it was a primary school. Only boys were studying. Girls were not coming for study because parents
                    were not interested to educate girl child. This school was upgraded into middle school under SSA Scheme in 2008. Parents were motivated to send their girls to school. After upgraded as middle school, the strength of students increased.
                    Both girls and boys were studying in this school. Few female teachers were also appointed to take care of girls student. Adolescent girls and female teachers were facing lots of problem due to poor sanitation facility. A small school
                    toilet was constructed by PHED, without proper water facility to keep toilet neat and clean. It was dirty and created bad odour. Noboby was using the toilets. Adolescent girls and female teachers were not able to go outside for toilet
                    because of thick population and houses. They could not use toilet in school premises because lack of sanitation facilities and girl children were not taking admission in the school. Therefore, to mitigate this problem, DC’s intervention
                    was necessary.
                </p>
                <p id="para-margin" style="font-family: Phenomena-Regular; font-size: 20px;">In the year 2011 Discipleship Centre started work in Darbhanga on Integrated Capacity Building of Flood Prone Community of Darbhanga. Under this program this middle school Ukhra was selected to construct sanitary complex. Ukhra School
                    was one of the schools out of 5 targeted schools. Under this program Discipleship Centre came forward to construct a sanitary complex in this school. After the meeting with the Headmaster of the school, girl children are slowly and
                    steadily joining the school.</p>
                <p id="para-margin" style="font-family: Phenomena-Regular; font-size: 20px;">The school toilet was constructed with following facilities- Urinal (Boys & Girls), changing room, sanitary napkin box, (specially for girls),3 mirrors, wash basin, running water with motor pump and incinerator for girls to disposal of
                    menstrual waste in the school. A student committee was formed where 15 students group will be called WATSAN committee who will look after and maintain the toilet complex. This committee will work on water, sanitation and hygiene to
                    maintain individual hygiene and cleanliness of toilet and surrounding of school campus. Bihar is located in the eastern part of the country. Bihar lies mid-way between the humid West Bengal in the east and the sub humid Uttar Pradesh
                    in the west. It is bounded by Nepal in the north and by Jharkhand in the south. The Bihar plain is divided into two unequal halves by the river Ganga which flows through the middle from west to east. Bihar is mainly a vast stretch
                    of very fertile flat land. It has several rivers namely Ganga, Son, Bagmati, Kosi, Budhi Gandak, and Falgu. Central parts of Bihar have some small hills, for example the Rajgir hills. Bagmati, Kosi, Budhi Gandak, and Falgu. Central
